              <p>
              I was fascinated with the idea of NYC ever since I landed in the US. With contending academic priorities, going to New York never ended up on top of the list. 
              But then, in the summer of 2015, I got an internship at a dimmer manufacturing company called Lutron Electronics. 
              It was in Allentown, Pennsylvania (very unhappening but great breweries!). The key thing though, was that it was just a few hours away from NYC. 
              In fact, to get to Allentown, I took a flight to NYC and drove from JFK, through the disorderly streets of Manhattan to Allentown. 
              I was in awe and this felt like a whole new America (more relatable!). It just felt as if a misfit in general social situations like me would somehow find a place here. 
              Little did I know, I would be residing there a few years fast-forward…
            </p>
            <p>
              After getting a little close to my then roommates at Lutron, I pestered them to travel with me to NYC (thanks Frank and Vincent!!). 
              It was the weekend of July 4th, so I knew this was going to be amazing. They only agreed to come if I agreed to try out a specific Duck dish in Chinatown. 
              This was a tough bargain as I wasn’t exposed to eating anything other than chicken when it came to meat. 
              I reluctantly agreed because the prospect of going to NYC with good company was a lot better than me travelling alone. We booked an AirBnB at a host’s apartment who had a single bad review (rookie mistake!). 
              Long story short, I had to call my close friend from Purdue (Harika) who had a generous friend who allowed us to live at her apartment in mid-town. 
              We all became good friends and set to explore NYC together and managed to celebrate 4th of July at the top of the Empire State. 
              I was in absolute awe of the vibes that this city gave me, but I was a little unsatisfied at not being able to see everything. 
              I went back to Allentown consequently to my university town.             
            </p>
            <p>
              I ended up graduating a semester earlier so used the last semester to plan one amazing trip back to NYC. 
              I knew I didn’t have enough funds to stay all nights, but I decided to go regardless. 
              I set out to travel alone and lived in a few shady AirBnb’s for the first few nights. During those first few days, 
              I only walked around the city (Manhattan and Brooklyn boroughs) until my legs gave in. 
              I must have walked all the way from Wall St to somewhere near Columbia and stopped at a dozen Halal Carts (overrated!). 
              After getting mildly bored, I decided to try out Hi-Hostels NYC (I had been to the Chicago version a few years ago) - this was a place where solo-travelers end up meeting. 
              I met a pretty diverse group one of these nights. (Danish, Middle eastern, Indian, French and Spanish folks). We celebrated New Year’s Eve together and its one of my most memorable times there. 
              I spent the last night in a Dunkin Donuts as I needed to save the last 50 bucks to travel back to my university town. I was quite content at being able to see what NYC had to offer but decided to head back to do some job searching…
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm going to focus Part II (<a href="#"> Coming soon...</a>) on how I ended up getting a job there and moved there for good.
