            <h2><a href="london.html">London Diaries - Part I</a></h2>
              <p>
                It took me a good 6 months and an embarassing walk back home with a date 
                to realize I know little about the city that I live in. She was sweet enough to tour guide and tell me the origins of Londinium and 
                the distinction between the City of London and Westminster.
            </p>
            <p>
              That experience left in me an unsatiated need to explore a little more on how London came about. So, I bought this book by Simon Jenkins 
              called "A Short History of London". Simon starts the first chapter encouraging me to ride a bicycle from the Tower of London to Covent Garden...<a href="london.html"> (More) </a>

              <p>
                One of my cognitive limitations is the inability to appreciate artistic work. I find it especially hard to indulge in second order thinking of any art form that I see. 
                I try to over-index on quantitative attributes on anything that I see. I decided to actively work on that by visiting the Guggenheim Mueseum in New York. It is an art lover's paradise. <a href="Guggenheim.html"> (More) </a>

              <p>
              I was fascinated with the idea of NYC ever since I landed in the US. With contending academic priorities, going to New York never ended up on top of the list. 
              But then, in the summer of 2015, I got an internship at a dimmer manufacturing company called Lutron Electronics. 
              It was in Allentown, Pennsylvania (very unhappening but great breweries!). The key thing though, was that it was just a few hours away from NYC. 
              In fact, to get to Allentown, I took a flight to NYC and drove from JFK, through the disorderly streets of Manhattan to Allentown. 
              I was in awe and this felt like a whole new America (more relatable!). It just felt as if a misfit in general social situations like me would somehow find a place here. 
              Little did I know, I would be residing there a few years fast-forwardâ€¦<a href="thebigapple-part1.html"> (More...) </a>

                I first came to Seattle for an interview with one of the then most sought after companies - Amazon. I was so excited about visiting and seeing what was so special about this place.
                Many of my friends had interned in a few companies in this region and spoke very highly of it. All of the hype was real, although, I'd like to say I saw a lot more of Seattle than they did in my time that I got to live there.
                I did end up moving to Seattle but not for Amazon but instead a small startup of 10 really talented people who made me the engineer I am today...<a href=#>(Coming Soon)</a>
